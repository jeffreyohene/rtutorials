# rtutorials: interactive statistics tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This R package is currently under active development.
It provides interactive `learnr` statistics 
tutorials, aiming to teach 
statistics along with the basics of the R programming language.  
It is in German language and directed at bachelor students of environmental and civil engineering, accompanying their first statistics lecture.

## Installation

### Quick Start

Copy the following code into your RStudio [console pane](https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/backgroud.html#rstudio-console-and-command-prompt) and hit Enter.

``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "learnr"))
devtools::install_github("statistik-lehre/rtutorials")
```

**Explanation**


`install.packages()` is a function that installs R packages. `devtools` and `learnr`. 

`learnr` is the framework we used to write the tutorials and required to run them.

`devtools` is a package that adds functionality to build R packages from source code. 
The source code for the tutorial package we want to build into a functional package that you can use 
is available in this repo. 

In the second line, we use the `install_github()` function and specify that it 
can be found within the `devtools` package with double colons `::`. Inside the brackets, we specify the last part of 
this GitHub Repository URL containing the source code. 

### Accessing the tutorials in RStudio

In RStudio, you will see the tutorials pane on the top left. Click there to
select from different tutorials and start them. 
It might require a R restart until the tutorials appear. 

Alternatively, to list all available tutorials, run

``` r
learnr::available_tutorials(package = "rtutorials")
```

And to run the individual tutorials:

### Einleitung

```r
learnr::run_tutorial("Einleitung", package = "rtutorials")
```
- why do we need statistics, why programming languages
- fist examples of R as a calculator


### Funktionen erkunden

```r
learnr::run_tutorial("Funktionen_erkunden", package = "rtutorials")
```

   - installing and loading packages
   - what is a script? what is a R notebook?
   - playfully learn the structure of function calls with `cowsay::say()`
   

### Vektoren

```r
learnr::run_tutorial("Vektoren", package = "rtutorials")
```

   - Learn how to assign content to a variable
   - how to find your variable in the environment
   - what is a vector?
   - combining vectors with `c()`
   - vector based calculations
   - vectorised nature of R 
   - Using the colon operator `:`

### Indizierung

```r
learnr::run_tutorial("Indizierung", package = "rtutorials")
```

   - What is indexing (subsetting)?
   - Subsetting with integer vectors
   - … with logical vectors
   - … with character vectors
   - Using your first conditional statements
