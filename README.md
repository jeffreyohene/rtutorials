# tutor: interactive statistics tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package provides interactive statistics tutorials, aiming to
learn statistics simultaneosly to the R programming language.  
It is tailored for third semester environmental and civil engineering
students of Kassel university in Germany, and therefore the content is
in German.

Another feature of this package is that it comes with real-life
engineering datasets instead of the fictious data, that many R courses
provide.  
This wants to facilitate a hands-on approach to data science with R that
is connected to real life and therefore preserving the joy of answering
real life questions.

## Installation

You can install the `tutor` package from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with the help of the `remotes` package, which you need to install first.
Copy the following code into your R console and hit Enter.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("statistik-lehre/tutor")
```

In RStudio, you will see the tutorials pane on the top left. Click there
to select from different tutorials and start them. Feedback and
contributions are welcome!
