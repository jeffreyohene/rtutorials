# tutor: interactive statistics tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package provides interactive statistics tutorials, aiming to
learn statistics in sync with the `R` programming language.  
It is tailored for third semester environmental and civil engineering
students of Kassel university in Germany, and therefore the content is
in German.

Another feature of this package is that it comes with real-life
engineering datasets instead of the fictious data, that many R courses
provide.  
This wants to facilitate a hands-on approach to data science with R that
is connected to real life and therefore preserving the joy of answering
real life questions.

## Installation

If you have not installed R and R-Studio, visit the first tutorial [here](https://pcijs6-el-be.shinyapps.io/1-Installation/).
